# AQA Simulator Calculator
A basic calculator app made using the AQA Simulator instruction set.
     ( AQA Simulator: https://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/AQA/ )

The calculator works much like the LMC version, with some added features:
+ Full support for negative numbers (multiplication + division)
+ Improved UI with ascii text.

These features were possible because of 3 main differences between the simulators:
1. The instruction set itself is more sophisticated in the AQA simulator, as it closely mimicks an ARM instruction set.
2. The memory capacity is far greater in the AQA simulator, with twice as many memory addresses and a 32 bit structure vs a 3 digit denary structure.
3. The output display is improved in the AQA simulator.

# TO RUN:
The calculator operates the same as the LMC version; simply go to the AQA site and follow the same instructions.

(NOTE: this calculator app takes time to multiply and divide large numbers. I find it starts to get slow a bit past the 200^^ mark)
