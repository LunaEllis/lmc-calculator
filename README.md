# lmc-calculator
A basic calculator app made using the Little Man Computer instruction set.

The calculator can perform Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication perfectly, and performs Division, but any decimals will be rounded down to the nearest integer.

# TO RUN:
1. Go to https://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/ (you can use an alternative site, but you may have to adjust the syntax a little)
2. Copy and paste the code into the "Program Area".
3. Hit "Submit", "Assemble into RAM", click "Run", and you're good to go!
4. [OPTIONAL] Click options, and set it to 'default fast', otherwise it'll run really slowly.

# KEY CODES
1 = ADD
2 = SUBTRACT
3 = MULTIPLY
4 = DIVIDE
Enter any other integer to end the program.
